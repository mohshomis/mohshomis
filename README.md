### hey, I'm Mohammed 👋

Backend engineer & tech lead based in the Netherlands. I spend most of my time building things with Django and TypeScript, thinking about system design, and lately getting deep into AI infrastructure.

I studied at Delft, was a TA there for a bit, and I'm currently leading engineering at a startup. On the side I run my own thing called ShoTech Solutions.

I also wrote a short book called **Software Is Not Code** — it's about the parts of software that nobody talks about in tutorials.

`Python` `Django` `TypeScript` `JavaScript` `REST APIs` `PostgreSQL` `AWS` `Docker`

**things I'm building / exploring**

- [AIVault](https://github.com/mohshomis/AIVault) — MCP server that lets AI agents use your secrets without ever seeing the actual values. Built this because pasting API keys into chat always felt wrong.
- contributing to open source AI infra — currently going deep on vLLM (LLM inference engine)
- ShoTech Solutions — software consulting & custom builds

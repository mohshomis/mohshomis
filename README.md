### hey, I'm Mohammed 👋

Backend engineer & tech lead based in the Netherlands. I like building things that actually work — clean APIs, solid architecture, systems that scale without drama.

I studied at Delft, spent some time as a TA there, and I've been writing code seriously for years. I'm the kind of person who reads about distributed systems on weekends for fun and ends up with a side project by Monday.

I also wrote a short book called **Software Is Not Code** — it's about the parts of software nobody talks about in tutorials.

**what I mostly work with**

`Python` `Django` `TypeScript` `JavaScript` `REST APIs` `PostgreSQL` `AWS` `Docker`

**things I'm building / exploring**

- [AIVault](https://github.com/mohshomis/AIVault) — MCP server that lets AI agents use your secrets without ever seeing the actual values. Built this because pasting API keys into chat always felt wrong.
- going deeper into AI infrastructure and LLM systems
- various side projects that scratch my own itches
